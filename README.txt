ChemWiz
=======

- A web-based InfoVis system to understand relation between compounds based on their chemical properties like Boiling and Melting points.
- It consists of 4 main visualizations, each of which provide a specific insights into the dataset.
- You can see this system at work here ->  http://www.yashksagar.com -> Projects -> ChemWiz -> Launch it!
- "UI.html" in the UI directory is the starting point.

- Thanks to Mike Bostock for his awesome data visualization library, D3.js (http://d3js.org/)
